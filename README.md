# nylonee's Oat Milk Chai Recipe

A version controlled recipe for Oat Milk Chai.

## Background
I was struggling to find a good chai recipe that used oat milk instead of regular milk, so I started experimenting with my own recipe. Hope you like it!

## Suggesting an improvement
Please raise a PR for any improvements that you suggest

## Backward compatibility
This repository supports backward compatibility on the satisfaction of a good chai. However, YMMV, and I recommend using the `main` branch for the best experience.
